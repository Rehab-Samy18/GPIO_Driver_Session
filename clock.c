 *0) Use RCC2 because it provides more options.
 *1) set the BYPASS2 (bit 11) bit. At this point the PLL is bypassed and there is no system clock divider.
 *2) specify the crystal frequency in the four XTAL bits using the code in Table 10.1.
 *   OSCSRC2 bits cleared to select the main oscillator as the clock source.
 *3) clear PWRDN2 (bit 13) to activate the PLL.
 *4) configure and enable the clock divider using the 7-bit SYSDIV2 field.
 *   If the 7-bit SYSDIV2 is n, then the clock will be divided by n+1.
 *   To get the desired 80 MHz from the 400 MHz PLL, we need to divide by 5. So, we place a 4 into the SYSDIV2 field.
 *5) wait for the PLL to stabilize by waiting for PLLRIS (bit 6) in the SYSCTL_RIS_R to become high.
 *6) The last step is to connect/enable the PLL by clearing the BYPASS2 bit.
 *   To modify this program to operate on other microcontrollers, you will need to change the crystal frequency and the system clock divider.
